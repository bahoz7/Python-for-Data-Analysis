    "<span style=\"font-size:14px; font-family: monospace\">short for Numerical Python, has long been a cornerstone of numerical computing in Python. It provides the data structures, algorithms, and library glue needed for most scientific applications involving numerical data in Python. NumPy contains, among other things:</span>\n",

    "<span style=\"font-size:14px; font-family: monospace\">pandas provides high-level data structures and functions designed to make working with structured or tabular data fast, easy, and expressive. Since its emergence in 2010, it has helped enable Python to be a powerful and productive data analysis environment. The primary  bjects in pandas that will be used in this book are the DataFrame , a tabular, column-oriented data structure with both row and column labels, and the Series , a one-dimensional labeled array object.  \n",
    "pandas blends the high-performance, array-computing ideas of NumPy with the flexible data manipulation capabilities of spreadsheets and relational databases (such as SQL).  \n",
    "It provides sophisticated indexing functionality to make it easy to reshape, slice and dice, perform aggregations, and select subsets of data. Since data manipulation, preparation, and cleaning is such an important skill in data analysis, pandas is one of the primary focuses of this book.  </span>\n",

It was originally created by John D. Hunter and is now maintained by a large team of developers. It is designed for creating plots suitable for publication. While there are other visualization libraries available to Python programmers, matplotlib is the most widely used and as such has generally good integration with the rest of the ecosystem. I think it is a safe choice as a default visualization tool.</span>\n",

In just seven years, it has had over 1,500 contributors from around the world. It includes submodules for such models as:</span>  \n",

    "<span style=\"font-size:14px; font-family: monospace\">statsmodels is a statistical analysis package that was seeded by work from Stanford University statistics professor Jonathan Taylor, who implemented a number of regression analysis models popular in the R programming language. Skipper Seabold and Josef Perktold formally created the new statsmodels project in 2010 and since then have grown the project to a critical mass of engaged users and contributors. Nathaniel Smith developed the Patsy project, which provides a formula or model specification framework for statsmodels inspired by R’s formula system.</span>  \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:14px; font-family: monospace\">Compared with scikit-learn, statsmodels contains algorithms for classical (primarily frequentist) statistics and econometrics. This includes such submodules as:</span>  \n",

    "- ```Analysis of variance (ANOVA)```  \n",
    "- ```Clustering: k-means, spectral clustering, etc.```  \n",
    "- ```Time series analysis: AR, ARMA, ARIMA, VAR, and other models```  \n",

    "- ```Visualization of statistical model results```  \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:14px; font-family: monospace\">statsmodels is more focused on statistical inference, providing uncertainty estimates and p-values for parameters. scikit-learn, by contrast, is more prediction-focused.</span> \n"
